### Booston House Pricing Prediction
This is a practice project that I did using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ1vWb1rGwM) tutorial

It basically uses **Linear Regression** Model to predict the price of a house based on it's data.

And I've used **Flask** framework to create 
1. an API,
2. a simple web page to get the house's data and showing the predicted value.

and at the end i've used **Dickerfile** to dockerize application

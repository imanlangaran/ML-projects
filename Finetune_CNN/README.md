# Finetune CNN

in this project which I wrote using [TensorFlow.org](https://colab.research.google.com/corgiredirector?site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tensorflow.org%2Fhub%2Ftutorials%2Ftf2_image_retraining), I've used a pre-trained model named `efficientnetv2-xl-21k` and added a single `Dense` Layer.

I've trained this Network using a public dataset provided by [Google](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz), which contained 3670 of 5 classes of flower photos.
